# Friendly Neighbourhood App

## Gamified Crowdsourced Civic Solutions

### Category: Open Innovation (SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities)

## Problem Statement
While numerous civic platforms address major infrastructural challenges, everyday community issuesâ€”like potholes, broken streetlights, power outages, and lost itemsâ€”often remain overlooked. Even routine problems like fixing a fan or replacing a SIM card remain unresolved or take excessive time. Traditional reporting systems are static and disengaging, leading to slow government responses and citizen frustration.

**Key Statistics:**
- 68% of urban residents express dissatisfaction with how minor civic issues are handled.
- 75% believe that an engaging, crowdsourced approach could accelerate local problem-solving and enhance community participation.

## Abstract
The current civic technology sector primarily focuses on large-scale infrastructure while neglecting daily disruptions urban citizens face. Issues like broken roads, leaking water systems, delayed transit services, and lost possessions negatively impact quality of life. Traditional channels fail due to a lack of real-time feedback, inadequate verification, and limited community involvement.

The **Friendly Neighbourhood App** transforms civic complaints into a **game-inspired** system using location-based tasks. The app encourages users to move from **simple problem reporting to active resolution**, fostering community participation.
